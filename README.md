# multimodal-live-api

The Multimodal Live API is a game-changer, enabling real-time, two-way interactions using text, audio, and video. Imagine having natural, human-like voice conversations with an AI, where you can interrupt it at any time. Add to that, the ability to share camera input or screencasts, and ask questions about the content - that is the power of the Multimodal Live API.
